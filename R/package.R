#' @description This package provides functions to compute potential models as 
#' defined by Stewart (1941) <doi:10.1126/science.93.2404.89>. Several options
#' are available to customize the models, such as the possibility to fine-tune 
#' the distance friction functions or to use custom distance matrices. Some 
#' computations are parallelized to improve their efficiency.
