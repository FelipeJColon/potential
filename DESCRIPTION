Description: Provides functions to compute potential models as defined by 
    Stewart (1941) <doi:10.1126/science.93.2404.89>. Several options are 
    available to customize the models, such as the possibility to fine-tune the 
    distance friction functions or to use custom distance matrices. 
    Some computations are parallelized to improve their efficiency.
