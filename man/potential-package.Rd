\title{Potential Models}
\description{
This package provides functions to compute potential models as
defined by Stewart (1941) <doi:10.1126/science.93.2404.89>. Several options
are available to customize the models, such as the possibility to fine-tune
the distance friction functions or to use custom distance matrices. Some
computations are parallelized to improve their efficiency.
